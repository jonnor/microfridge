Beer detector
------

* Rig up N load-cells, each with space for one beer can/bottle.
* Counting the beers amounts to verifying how many load-cells have the weight of a beer-like object
* Alternative methods include optical, but more vunerable to false positives
* The structure should be such that only beers can fit easily and be clearly marked to be for beer
