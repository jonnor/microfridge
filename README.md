MicroFridge
============

Firmware for an old fridge, based on [MicroFlo](http://microflo.org) dataflow runtime
running on [Olimex ESP8266](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP8266-EVB).

This is version 2 of the
[MicroFlo+Arduino-based fridge](http://www.jonnor.com/2013/09/microflo-0-1-0-and-an-arduino-powered-fridge/).
